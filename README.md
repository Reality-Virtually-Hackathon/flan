### Inspiration

There's a challenge for consumers ordering food from home or even in a restaurant to get a good understanding of portion sizes, ingredients that they might not be familiar with, and most importantly to have a 3d model to represent what the consumer is getting at the end.

### What it does
The Flan app lets consumers customize their dishes by selecting each ingredient, avoiding dishes with ingredients they are allergic to, selecting recommended dishes by popularity, and seeing the finished dish they are getting from a restaurant.

### How we built it
Our team built the Flan app using Unity, ARCore, Cinema 4D, Sketch, Trinio (photogrammetry), and Python for the recommendation engine.

### Challenges we ran into
The photogrammetry is prone to errors requiring specific lighting and movement.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of

Finding, forming, and collaborating with a new team. ARCore was new to all developers as well as photogrammetry for the designers.

### What we learned

ARCore, photogrammetry, collaborated filtering for the recommendation engine.

### What's next for Flan

Continue to build features using ARCore and enhancing the 3d models for other restaurants.
